Unlike traditional contractors, Celestir operates with Silicon Valley urgency—deploying solutions that solve the universe's hardest problems.

This is a role that can operate remotely, or within Washington, DC/New York, NY. The ideal candidate MUST be a US citizen or Green Card holder. We will have to auto-reject any candidate who is neither of those.

Celestir seeks a Data Scientist (Federal) who thrives in the crucible of high-stakes innovation. This role demands ruthless intensity—shipping production models under federal deadlines while advancing peer-reviewed research at startup speed. You’ll operate in an ""academic utopia"" with Ivy League-grade resources but zero tolerance for theoretical thumb-twiddling.

Compensation Philosophy:

• Performance Bonus: 5–40% of base
• Total Target Comp: $136,500–$201,500

Ruthless Intensity
• Deliver client ML solutions in 72hr sprints or less

Academic Utopia
• Publish or Perish (Rewarded): 5% base bonus for every top-tier conference paper accepted
• Annual ""Moonshot Budget"" to test practical bleeding-edge ideas (quantum ML, neurosymbolic AI)

Core Responsibilities
• Client Work: (Example): Build intrusion detection systems where 99.9% precision isn’t a goal—it’s a contract requirement.
• Product Dev: Ship code that passes both CI/CD pipelines and academic peer review.
• Grant Execution: Turn whiteboard theoretics into funded realities

Non-Negotiables
• Intellect: PhD or 5+ published papers in ML/security (arXiv submissions don’t count)
• Stamina: 50–55hr baseline with midnight deploys during critical incidents
• Pride: Openly critique peer designs in daily code reviews—then buy them whiskey afterward
• Ability to obtain clearance.

Why Celestir?
• Elite Guild: While Silicon Valley obsesses over ads, we’re rewriting the rules of intelligence warfare. Bring your ego—we’ll incinerate it in the crucible.
• No Mediocrity Tax: Underperformers (<90% OKRs) exit within 3mo—top performers get 25%-50% YoY comp bumps.
• Legacy: Your work will secure U.S. satellites, not another TikTok recommender.","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on their expertise in economics and mathematics, they sought to address the challenge of evaluating borrowers' creditworthiness more accurately and efficiently. Through meticulous data analysis and modeling, Fair and Isaac pioneered the concept of credit scoring, introducing statistical techniques to predict the likelihood of loan default based on historical data. Their innovative Fair Isaac Credit Scoring System, launched in 1956, revolutionized lending practices by providing lenders with a quantitative tool to assess risk objectively. This development not only improved access to credit for deserving individuals but also laid the foundation for modern credit scoring methodologies that continue to shape financial decision-making today.

Description


Principal Associate, Data Scientist, Model Risk Office
Data is at the center of everything we do. As a startup, we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast\\-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data\\-driven decision\\-making.


As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in computing and machine learning technologies and operating across billions of customer records to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

#### **Team Description:**


In Capital One’s Model Risk Office, we defend the company against model failures and find new ways of making better decisions with models. We use our statistics, software engineering, and business expertise to drive the best outcomes in both Risk Management and the Enterprise. We understand that we can’t prepare for tomorrow by focusing on today, so we invest in the future: investing in new skills, building better tools, and maintaining a network of trusted partners. We learn from past mistakes, and develop increasingly powerful techniques to avoid their repetition.

#### **Role Description**


In this role, you will:

* Partner with a cross\\-functional team of data scientists, software engineers, and product managers to identify and quantify risks associated with models
* Leverage a broad stack of technologies — Python, Conda, AWS, Spark, and more — to reveal the insights hidden within data
* Build statistical/machine learning models to challenge “champion models” that are deployed in production today
* Contribute to the model governance of the next generation of machine learning models
* Flex your interpersonal skills to present how model risks could impact the business to executives


The Ideal Candidate is:

* Innovative. You continually research and evaluate emerging technologies. You stay current on published state\\-of\\-the\\-art methods, technologies, and applications and seek out opportunities to apply them.
* Creative. You thrive on bringing definition to big, undefined problems. You love asking questions and pushing hard to find answers. You’re not afraid to share a new idea.
* Technical. You’re comfortable with open\\-source languages and are passionate about developing further. You have hands\\-on experience developing data science solutions using open\\-source tools and cloud computing platforms.
* Statistically\\-minded. You’ve built models, validated them, and backtested them. You know how to interpret a confusion matrix or a ROC curve. You have experience with clustering, classification, sentiment analysis, time series, and deep learning.

Principal Associate, Data Scientist, Model Risk Office
Data is at the center of everything we do. As a startup, we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast\\-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data\\-driven decision\\-making.
