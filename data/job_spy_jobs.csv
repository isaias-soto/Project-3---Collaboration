After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.



So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.



Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.


**The Role**



We are seeking a highly motivated and experienced Senior Machine Learning Engineer with a specialization in Modeling to join our Go\\-To\\-Market (GTM) Expansion ML team at Square.

**You Will**


* Develop and implement machine learning and deep learning models for churn risk assessment and product recommendations, analyzing seller activity across Square's ecosystem of payments, banking, and SaaS products.
* Design and build systems that utilize Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to address critical GTM business challenges and enhance interactions with Square sellers.
* Advocate for engineering best practices, and contribute to the upskilling of the team.
* Drive end\\-to\\-end cross\\-functional machine learning projects: build relationships with partner teams, frame problem statements, collect and analyze data, research and build prototypes, and productionize ML solutions by designing and developing their full pipelines.
* Help build the next generation of AI applications for GTM \\& Sales/AM teams at Square.


**You Have**


* 6\\+ years of experience in ML software development.
* Understanding of and experience with the entire ML development lifecycle, including project setup, data pipelines, model training/serving, and monitoring.
* A track record of designing and maintaining production\\-level machine learning systems.
* Experience with large language models and generative AI.
* Strong grasp of computer science fundamentals.
* Proficient coding skills and comfort with coding in production systems.
* Commitment to writing clean and maintainable code.

 We are reducing agriculture's global greenhouse gas emissions to improve the world we live in!
   

  

 Agoro Carbon Alliance addresses a key global problem, the impact of agriculture's global greenhouse gas emissions on our climate and the implementation of sustainable carbon capturing potential at the ranch and farm. Our passion lies in solving a global crisis by working with our customers to bring about the sustainable transformation of ranching and farming practices which is both economically viable for the grower and helps the world avoid a crisis.
   

  

 A bit about the role:
   

  

 Our team brings together knowledge in (geo\\-)statistics, agriculture, soil and carbon science, as well as applied data science to support Agoro's monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) process of greenhouse gas emissions \\- with a primary focus on soil carbon sequestration.
   

  

 As a data scientist \\- within our Carbon Science and analytics team, you will contribute to the development of robust carbon modelling approaches, in the context of the design and implementation of:
   




* stratification approaches, for physical soil sampling purposes
* a cost\\-effective monitoring approach of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, resulting from various sustainable management practices.


  

 Your work will drive several aspects of Agoro's core business, for instance:
   

* assess soil sequestration potential and prioritize areas for business development
* optimize carbon credit claims, by ensuring robustness and traceability of the ""carbon journey""
* decrease the cost of SOC quantification by the innovative combination of different approaches


  

  

 Summary
   

  

 You will combine your expertise in deploying existing carbon models, such as DayCent, DNDC, etc. with the use of other approaches, gradually including remote and proximal sensing data for carbon monitoring. To do that, you will work closely with remote sensing experts. You will be expected to leverage a wide range of datasets, going all the way from global climate data to local ranch or farm/field data. Your models will span across various ranges of spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. You'll be expected to be able to handle these independently. Carbon crediting resulting from the implementation of sustainable management practices in farms and ranches, evolves in a rapidly changing ""regulatory"" framework. Your agility and eagerness to continuously suggest and develop innovative ideas will therefore be an important feature of your profile. You will be working with our data engineering team to build your prototypes to production and running on scale.
   

  

 What you will be doing
   

* The preferred candidate will support building and analysing ecosystem model datasets, using state\\-of\\-the\\-art computing frameworks/algorithms to help calibrate/validation process\\-based models, and be able to tune your models efficiently.
* You would primarily contribute to our current modeling effort, develop and implement algorithms that will help improve carbon simulation models and support measurement, reporting and verification of soil carbon stock changes and trace gas emission reductions.
* You would be encouraged to innovate solutions for more efficient high\\-throughput processing of survey data into model inputs. The successful candidate will thrive on meeting challenges, insist on high quality deliverables, demonstrate effective problem\\-solving skills, and possess the ability to build productive external and internal relationships.
* Collect, compile, and analyze datasets relevant for soil carbon modeling for agriculture and rangeland applications; build model inputs, analyze simulation results, identify possible issues if any and provide insight into simulated soil organic carbon dynamics.
* Use specialized knowledge and current literature when identifying and implementing process improvement; bring academic research, technology and practical experience together to drive Agoro's soil modeling strategy forward.
* Rapidly prototype and iterate to build production ready solutions that scale.


  

 What you will bring:
   

* Bachelor's degree required; MS/PhD in Agriculture/Environmental science/Soil science, or Applied Math, Statistics preferred.
* Minimum of 3 years' experience working with environmental, soil carbon modeling systems, or terrestrial modeling.
* Expertise in working with relevant soil carbon models (e.g., DayCent, DNDC) is critical.
* Knowledge of processes related to soil carbon sequestration and process\\-based models (i.e, DayCent, DNDC, APEX, SWAT\\-C etc.) and their requirements.
* Excellent analytical skills to find solutions to meet business needs.
* Ability to work effectively as a part of a team.
* Strong intention to learn and contribute to the success of the team.
* Highly proficient and experienced in scripting languages such as Python and R, statistical and modelling packages, and rapid prototyping, with ability to write clean, sharable and efficient code.
* You are an effective communicator of technical concepts to both technical and non\\-technical resources.
* Pragmatic, solution driven and technology agnostic. You focus on results, and get things done.
* Prior agricultural experience is a plus, especially in a commercial context.
* Fluent in English
* Fluent in Portuguese is a plus, not required.


  

 What will set you apart:
   

* You have experience using Machine Learning in modeling frameworks.
* You are competent at, and enjoy developing analytical solutions/tools, producing value\\-added datasets, writing up and reporting results.
* You have experience developing process\\-based ecosystem models.
* You have a solution\\-oriented mindset.


  

  

 Why work with us?
   

* We offer the opportunity to drive change by globally reducing carbon emissions while financially supporting growers.
